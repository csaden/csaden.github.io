<p class="about">Hi, my name is Chris Saden, and I write about education, computer science, and self-improvement. I enjoy learning, and I value the transformative power of delightful educational experiences. When I'm not plugged in to a computer or a phone, I enjoy letting my mind wander on a run.</p>
