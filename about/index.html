<p class="about">Hi, my name is Chris Saden, and I write about user experiences,
 data visualization, and software engineering. I enjoy learning, and I value
 the transformative power of educational experiences. When I'm not
 tinkering on a computer, you can find me running through the parks of San
 Francisco.
