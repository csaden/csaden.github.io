### What did you learn today?

Shortly is the title of our newest sprint, and the sprint challenged us to build an application like [bitly](https://bitly.com/). We're making use of express.js, it's middleware, and authenticating a user with a session. My pair and I figured out how to hash, store, and validate user passwords. Tomorrow, we'll tackle the bugs in our routing which relate to a "session" and a user's cookie. We need to create another table to store user ids and session information. We've got a plan in place, and I think we'll do well.


### Did you learn anything new about yourself?

There are so many online courses that I want to take right now: Introduction to Recommender Systems, Human-Centered Design, and Responsive Images. I don't have time for them all on top of the coding, writing, and reading I'm doing for HackReactor. I don't like saying no to new learning opportunities.


### Anything you want to do differently tomorrow?

My pair and I created a plan and wrote pseudocode before writing any lines of code. I'd like to do that again tomorrow.

I'd also like to pack my lunch and eat outside.
