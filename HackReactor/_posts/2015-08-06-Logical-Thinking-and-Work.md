### What did you learn today?

The morning kicked off with a Junior/Senior toy problem, but sadly, many seniors were tired from yesterday, which was their Hiring Day. They spent most of the day interviewing, talking about themselves and their projects, and solving toy problems. I did not end up finding a senior so I played the role of interviewer and offered the maximumSubArray (or arraySum problem) to one of my peers. He did a great job or working through an example and coming up with logical rules for what to do as worked with one example problem. He tried to uncover structure in the problem, and it was interesting to see toy problem and algorithm generation from the side of the interviewer. Overall, he did great in solving the problem, and we spent the last few minutes discussing strengths and ways to improve.

The rest of my day was spent working on our new Greenfield project. We decided to build a music player similar to Rockbot and Festify. The app will let a host create a play list, share it with friends or guests, and guests can add songs and up vote ones they'd like to hear.

My work was focused on the back end. I set up a MongoDB with User, Song, and Playlist Schemas, and I made use of methods for two of the three Schema. I learned more about MongoDB, including Arrays, methods, querying, promises, saving models, and error handling. I'll need to learn a lot more about error handling, especially when it comes to gracefully handling errors to be route back to the client. I think I'm most of the way there so I'm looking forward to working with the other two guys who are handling the front end of our project.

### Did you learn anything new about yourself?

I'm becoming more fearless when it comes to trying code out, and I'm getting faster at reading documentation and solving problems quickly. I still need to do a better job of testing incrementally.

### Anything you want to do differently tomorrow?

I want to code a little and test a little. I tended to code in big chunks today without any testing. I can do better.
