### What did you learn today?

Today, we started a sprint to create a MVP, or minimum viable product. We were given the freedom to create a piece of software on our own and scope our own feature set. Throughout the morning lecture, we were told, "Now, we're going to give you a chance to fail." Failure is a great thing and even more so when learning. I think I've come to embrace failure as a way to examine successes and mistakes in logic and process. I think this sprint is going to be particularly great in that I'm bound to fail in some aspect: a plan of too many features, underestimation of the time window, or lack of clarity in what I'm building. I've decided to build a google form like application for getting written responses from a crowd. The app is called [Writelet](https://github.com/csaden/2015-06-mvp).

### Did you learn anything new about yourself?

I need to be less critical of myself when I'm brainstorming. The ideation process should be more fun.

### Anything you want to do differently tomorrow?

I stayed up later working on Writelet so I'd like to go to bed on the earlier side.
