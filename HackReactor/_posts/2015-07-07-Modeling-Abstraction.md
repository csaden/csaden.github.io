### What did you learn today?

I learned about abstraction and recursion by watching a solution video of a seasoned programmer code a solution to the n-rooks and n-queens problem. It was eye opening to hear the thinking of a programmer as he abstracted methods, utilized recursion, and re-factored function signatures to arrive at the solution.

### Did you learn anything new about yourself?

No, I like to learn, but I've known that about myself since I was in elementary school.

### Anything you want to do differently tomorrow?

I want to schedule dinner with a friend in San Francisco that I haven't seen in a while.
