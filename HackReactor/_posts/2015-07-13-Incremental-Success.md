### What did you learn today?

For the newest sprint on chatterbox, I focused on thinking about the problem, writing pseudocode, and reasoning abstractly when needed. My pair and I did an excellent job of breaking the problem down into small problems, and we focused on our solution first before working towards passing the specifications for testing. By taking this approach, we were more confident in our code, and we learned more about code organization by comparing our work to the setup (function names, classes, and ids) in the specs.

### Did you learn anything new about yourself?

I had a hangover and a throbbing headache through the day. Happy Birthday to my mom and Shaun! Note to self, drink more water.

### Anything you want to do differently tomorrow?

I want to get the basic requirements done for the project and not waste too much time styling the chatterbox app. I want to move onto the spline repo and spend most of my time learning and using Backbone.js.
