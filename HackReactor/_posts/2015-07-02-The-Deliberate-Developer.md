### What did you learn today?

I find myself consistently thinking about communication. HackReactor has impressed upon me the importance of refining questions carefully, asking the right question, and tuning my diction and tone to fit different situations. I'm impressed that this program puts just as much excellence into coding as it does communication.

### Did you learn anything new about yourself?

I tend to sugar coat problems instead of addressing them head on. When addressing problems, I need to ask for permission when addressing problems that I perceive from others, feel out tense situations, and provide my input carefully yet truthfully to move forward with actionable steps toward a desired outcome.

### Anything you want to do differently tomorrow?

Pack my lunch! I went to the grocery store today.
