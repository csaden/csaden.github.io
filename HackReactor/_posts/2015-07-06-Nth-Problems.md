### What did you learn today?

I learned about the n-queens and n-rooks program. I discovered the n-queens can be considered a depth first search problem. The n-queens problem can also be solved using a bitwise representation of the board (*this is when Neo from the Matrix says "whoa!"*).

I find myself more bored in the lecture than most days. I think it's because we still haven't hit truly novel topics so most of the content feels like review.

### Did you learn anything new about yourself?

I like coding up solutions to problems. I like to think mathematically and abstractly (with variables and recursions) to solve problems.

### Anything you want to do differently tomorrow?

I said the words "you guys" when leaving for the night. I was with two students, one of who considers themselves to be agender (note my use of the word "themselves"). The student prefers to be addressed with pronouns "they", "them", and "theirs". I wonder when I said "you guys" when addressing my two classmates if that made the student who identifies as agender uncomfortable. I'm trying to keep a pulse on clear communication throughout this program, and I think I could have done better today in that situation.

And one other thing, I want to go to bed by 11 PM so that I can get at least 8 hours of sleep and work out in the morning.
