### What did you learn today?

I learned that I didn't fully understand GET, POST, and PUT requests when it comes to servers. I spent a lot of time reviewing node.js documentation and http requests as my pair and I tackled our sprint assignment to build a server to respond to client requests. Instead of building out the routes and callback functions using node.js, my pair and I decided to use express.js to write clean code. We had trouble finding the appropriate documentation and examples to have a successful application. I'm sure with additional patience and thoughtful experimentation we can achieve the goals of the sprint tomorrow.

### Did you learn anything new about yourself?

I'd rather ask someone else how to do something when it comes to discovering syntax or putting multiple parts together in code. I have little patience when it comes to reading poor* documentation *(note: the use of the word poor means that the documentation is unclear, particular functionality is not explained, or the examples are not sufficient)*. I think I need to get used to it.

### Anything you want to do differently tomorrow?

I want to go to bed earlier. I keep staying up late to code problems, and I don't get too far with the additional effort. My time would be better spent sleeping, and I'd feel more refreshed to exercise and tackle another day at HackReactor.
