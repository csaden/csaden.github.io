I write about education, computer science, data science, and self-improvement. I'm a data science and data visualization enthusiast with a penchant for learning and problem solving. I value the transformative power of educational experiences, mentoring, and feedback. When I'm not writing, coding or learning, I enjoy letting my mind wander on a run.
