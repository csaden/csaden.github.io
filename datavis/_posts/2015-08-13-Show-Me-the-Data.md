I'm excited to start a new section of my blog dedicated to data visualization and data stories!

I started learning about data visualization while working on a course for Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree program. The [course](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-visualization-and-d3js--ud507) covers data visualization fundementals &mdash; visual encodings, chart types, color theory, common pitfalls and data narratives &mdash; and D3.js, a javascript library for manipulating documents with data.

I knew little about data visualization before teaching the course so I took to books, the web, and news publications to augment my knowledge. I read books from Edward Tufte and Alberto Cairo. I reviewed curriculum from Washington University (thanks Jeff Heer), Rice (thanks Hadley Wickham), UC Berkeley, and Duke University. I listened to podcasts from Moritz Stefaner and Enrico Bertini over at [Data Stories](http://datastori.es/). And I curated knowledge from sites such as [VizWiz](http://vizwiz.blogspot.com/), [PerceptualEdge](https://www.perceptualedge.com/), and [StorytellingWithData](http://www.storytellingwithdata.com/). Needless to say, I was immersed in data visualization and loved analyzing the science and art of any graphic that I found.

I learned much about information design though that process, and I continue to learn more about the field each week. I look forward to sharing graphics that I stumble upon, and I hope you'll join me in continuing the dialogue about graphics. Whether graphics are static, interactive, colorless, colorful, beautiful, hideous, artful, minimal, honest, confusing, or informative, they all try to convey message. Let's see how to convey that message best.
