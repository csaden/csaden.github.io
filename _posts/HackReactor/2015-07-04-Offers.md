*Day 5*

### What did you learn today?

My ability to discuss data structures, algorithms, and run time complexity accurately for problems during interviews will determine my success for getting a great offer.

Hiring software engineers doesn't work like most traditional roles; however, interview style puzzle questions still remain fairly common. A CS degree is optional, but some companies won't consider you for a role if you lack such a degree. I found it odd that hiring remains strong for engineers in December and January over the holidays.

HackReactor takes feedback and student outcomes seriously. That's refreshing. I'm consistently impressed by the staff's ability to communicate expectations and calibrate our own attitudes against them.

### Did you learn anything new about yourself?

I don't readily share things about myself with new people. I tend to ask people questions, and I tend to listen more than I speak.

### Anything you want to do differently tomorrow?

I want to eat lunch and dinner with people in my cohort that I haven't spent time with yet.
