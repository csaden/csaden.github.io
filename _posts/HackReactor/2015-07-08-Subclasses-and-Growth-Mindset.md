### What did you learn today?

Today, I learned about implementing subclasses in Javascript. This is a tricky topic in Javascript, and many web resources and blogs have contradictory information on the subject. I recently read two blog articles about OLOO (Objects Linking to Other Objects), and I think Javascript makes a lot more sense when you think about delegating to other objects and passing around objects and functions.

In terms of communication, I think I've done a better job of articulating my thought processes, concerns, and questions to my pair. We worked through the coding sprint well even though we hit many code blocks along the way.

### Did you learn anything new about yourself?

I don't naturally get excited when it comes to using CSS to design the front-end of web pages. I think there are two reasons for this. One, I don't consider myself all that knowledgeable in CSS. And two, I don't consider myself as a well-skilled artist or designer. I need to push those two thoughts aside and have a [growth mindset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carol_Dweck) when it comes to making applications look great. I can learn CSS properties and good design, and I will learn them over the remaining 11 weeks.

### Anything you want to do differently tomorrow?

I need to pay close attention to announcements and descriptions of the sprints. I missed an entire repo of work that we needed to do, and if my pair and I had completed that work before diving into the work of the sprint, it's more likely that we would not have encountered so many problems. Professor Pajares wrote "the devil is in the details" on my college papers when I made grammar or punctuation mistakes. I should listen to that advice.
