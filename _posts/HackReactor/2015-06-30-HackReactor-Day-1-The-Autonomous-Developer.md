*Day 1*

These posts cover my time at HackReactor from Monday, June 29, 2015 through Saturday, September 26, 2015. In these post I tried to capture life at HackReactor, including my attitudes about learning and coding, the broad strokes of computer science, and my ability to communicate effectively.

Every night or the next morning I reflected about my experiences and answered three questions.

- What did you learn today?
- Did you learn anything new about yourself?
- Anything you want to do differently tomorrow?

### What did you learn today?

I was surprised that the number one HackReactor's program is to develop autonomy in students. Developing autonomy and soft skills stand out as the first and second goals of the program. Marcus had an excellent lecture on these points (as well as how to become strong technically in CS fundamentals and interview questions). I was most surprised how much time was spent aligning expectations, explaining what is and what is not provided, and how we should frame ourselves (in a positive and willing participant) even when the program tests new curriculum on us no matter if the curriculum is polished or not. I know I want to focus on my communication throughout the program, especially during pair programming exercises and the projects. I can use "I feel" statements to call out behaviors or attitudes about myself or those that I'm working with rather than a "you are" statement, which can put people on the defensive.  No, I attempted all the problems today. I got a bit tired during the late afternoon. I shouldn't go to bed so early because I'll end up waking up at 3am.

### Did you learn anything new about yourself?

I know I want to focus on my communication throughout the program, especially during pair programming exercises and the projects. Today, I encountered many techniques such as using "I feel" statements to call out behaviors or attitudes about myself or those that I'm working with rather than a "you are" statement, which can put people on the defensive.

### Anything you want to do differently tomorrow?

No, I attempted all of the problems today. I got a bit tired during the late afternoon because I went to bed around 7pm. I wanted to be well rested for the program and that planning back fired. I shouldn't go to bed so early because I'll end up waking up at 3am.
