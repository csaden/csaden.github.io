### What did you learn today?

Today, I practiced planning, coding a little, and checking a little. This incremental and iterative approach to writing code will serve me well in the future. While building an arcade game, my pair and I implemented and tested small changes as we implemented basic requirements. My pair emphasized planning from the beginning, and I think that was a solid approach that I should continue to use in future sprints and my work flow in general.

### Did you learn anything new about yourself?

It's satisfying when your code works as intended.

### Anything you want to do differently tomorrow?

I need to learn more about animations, timing, and d3.js. I also want to write a blog post about they key function in the `.data()` function for d3.js. I don't think I will have the time tomorrow, but I should write the technical post one evening or on a Sunday.
